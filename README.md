## Overview

The Pottery Webstore is a Django-based web application that was built in the interest of a small business owner who wished to market their Pottery, but didn't have knowledge of coding or web design.

The aim was to create both a functional site where products could be added, edited and removed, and where customers could buy and order products to be shipped all over the world but at least within the UK.

- This colour palette was adhered to in the login and logout page

## Features

- User registration, login, authentication and logout, to ensure that key data could be tracked for the user such as their shopping cart.

- Product management (add, edit, delete products), so that the coding unaware business owner can edit their inventory for sale. They are able to customise the product title and image displayed, enabling as many different products to be added as they wish, without requiring coding knowledge.

- Shopping cart functionality and readability, where the cart displays the items within and even how many are included throughout the website. 

- Order management, the database tracks which products have been ordered

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

- User-friendly interface, kept clean and simple
